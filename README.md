### Documentation goes here
#### But what do I put in the documentation?

- Tag uses.
- Layer uses (for collision, culling, and raycasting â€“ essentially, what should be in what layer).
- GUI depths for layers (what should display over what).
- Scene setup.
- Prefab structure of complicated prefabs.
- Idiom preferences.
- Build setup.
